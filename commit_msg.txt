Improve route visuals, responsive markers, and header graphics

- map.js:
  - Scale dashed-route spacing with `zoom` and `routeLineWidth`; shorten dash/gap lengths.
  - Make dash animation speed scale with `zoom` for consistent perceived speed.
  - Add `routeLineWidth` and `getRouteNodeSize()`; use these so node dots scale with stroke and zoom.
  - Ensure markers and hitboxes are always slightly larger than route nodes (`getBaseMarkerRadius()` references node size).
  - Make route stroke fully opaque.
  - Sanitize `routeDir` localStorage parsing to avoid initial 0 value bug.
- index.html:
  - Add stacked SVG logo (ball above geotag) left of title/subtitle.
  - Rewire favicon and logo references to `graphics/`.
  - Group footer control hints so related labels (e.g. `0/ Reset`) do not break across lines.
- styles.css:
  - Header layout and title block for stacked logo; per-asset sizing (.logo-ball, .logo-geotag).
  - Add spin animation for the ball logo (4s loop) with `prefers-reduced-motion` respected.
  - Add hint-group styling to prevent unintentional line breaks.
- graphics/:
  - Added `mp4b_routing_logo_ball.svg` and `mp4b_routing_logo_geotag.svg` and moved favicons into `graphics/`.

Notes: multiple UX and rendering tweaks to keep visuals consistent across zoom levels and to centralize graphics assets for easier maintenance.
